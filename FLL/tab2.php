Birthday in a Box  Charity outreach event <br/>
<br/>
for: RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE CHARITIES OF BALTIMORE INC.<br/>
http://www.rmhcincinnati.org/volunteer-birthday-box.aspx<br/>
<br/>
No one wants to spend their birthday away from home - or worse yet, in the hospital. Unfortunately due to long illnesses, that is exactly what many of our families are forced to do. Your special gift of birthday party supplies will go a long way towards making the day a little more special.<br/>
<br/>
Note to our FLL Teams:   <br/>
Your FLL team can participate in this outreach project in any manner that works for your team! You can choose to bring in a few items on the list, or you can decorate and bring in an entire box, it's up to you!   <br/>
<br/>
An ideal Birthday in a Box would include all the supplies required for a small party of 4 or more. Make it fun and be creative. We have children and parents with us of all ages and backgrounds, so you really can't go wrong in choosing any color scheme or party theme. Your box is sure to please someone. <br/>
<br/>
instructions:<br/>
Please use a re-closable, stackable box no bigger than 2' x 3' (copy paper sized)<br/>
Clearly label each box indicating the intended recipient's age and gender<br/>
List not only the contents of the box, but the number of each item (6 plates, 6 cups, 1 streamer, etc.)<br/>
Identify the party theme (ie. SpongeBob, adult Over the Hill, sports, springtime) or color (red, white and blue or plain purple)<br/>
Only include non-toxic, non-perishable materials<br/>
<br/>
suggestions:<br/>
Here are a few ideas to get you started, but your ideas are welcome! (It is not necessary to include all items.)<br/>
Boxed baking mixes (cake, cookies, brownies, etc.)<br/>
Icing (tub, squeeze tube, etc.)<br/>
Sprinkles or other cake decoration<br/>
Cupcake papers<br/>
Candles<br/>
Paper plates, cups, napkins<br/>
Plastic cutlery, tablecover, centerpiece<br/>
Simple party games<br/>
